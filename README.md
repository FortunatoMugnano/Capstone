# PROJECT NAME
ENTER-Q!


# APP OVERVIEW

ENTER-Q! is an app where users can keep tracking of their personal job searches. There are different sections:  DREAM JOB where users can add the jobs they would love to apply and maybe obtain! When they decide to apply to any job, the APPLIED JOB section is where the "Job Card" will be moved. In this section, whenever the users click on Details for any single "Job Card", there will be two buttons: one to be used if the recruiter/employer has rejected your application,  and the other one if they offer you an interview. In the case of a rejection, the Job Card will be moved to the REJECTED section. Otherwise, if they offer you an interview, this will be moved to the INTERVIEW section. When the users are in the INTERVIEW section, other two buttons will be presented. If the users click on GOT AN OFFER, that means they have received one! In this part of the App, they can also contribute to add comments about the interview(s) and the hiring process if they desire. This is the last section of my app, here they can provide the informations about the salary, if not specified at the beginning, and some notes about the entire hiring process. Two more features will be:  

COMMENT & COMPANIES section: here the users can search for different comments related to a single company

REMIND ME TO FOLLOW UP this feature will set up an automatic message on the users home page. The message will remind them to follow up to the company/recruiter after a week of their interview
